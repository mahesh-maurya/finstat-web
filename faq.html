In order to become an Actuary one must clear 15 papers along with 3 years of professional working experience.
                                                        <br>The breakup of the same is as follows:</p>

However, the course structure involves a considerable amount of statistical, analytical skills along with financial application of the skills.

For example, a student pursuing graduation in commerce stream may appear for CT2 - Finance and Financial Reporting exam while a student from science stream can give CT3 - Probability and Statistics exam, etc.
                                                    </p>

                                                        There is no prescribed duration of the course. However, the course structure requires excellent skills along with hard work.
